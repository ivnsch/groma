    // sync properties - FIXME - while Realm allows to return Realm objects from async op. This shouldn't be in model objects.
    // the idea is that we can return the db objs from query and then do sync directly with these objs so no need to put sync attributes in model objs
    // we could map the db objects to other db objs in order to work around the Realm issue, but this adds even more overhead, we make a lot of mappings already
