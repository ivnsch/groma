    // Note that of course there's also a serverside check for this, but we need clientside also to filter these inventories so the user doesn't see or can't interact with them.
    // The reason we have inventories in the client they have no access to, is that the list needs a target inventory
    // we could maybe allow lists without target inventory, but this would need changes we have to think about. Having always the inventory is easier to implement.
    // Note also that the current implementation means any user who has access to a list associated with unauthorised inventory receives the emails of the shared users of this inventory
    // this is not great (TODO) but for now also don't consider it a big issue, as if someone shares a list with a user (note though - this someone not necessarily has access to the inventory neither), it means there's trust between the users / they know themselves (at least indirectly). In most cases they'll also be sharing the inventory.
    // Note also that here (list) we don't send inventory items.
